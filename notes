Pinball

We need something similar to lab 5a, but with the ability to place
immovable objects in the field.


Maybe make a more serious class structure (Prof often brings up OOP in lecture)

Only the ball needs ODE solver(?)
Forces on the ball won't

Floppers will rotate in place, maybe make the hinge of the flopper in it's center
with half of it hidden by the game boundary
